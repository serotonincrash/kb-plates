# kb-plates
This repository is to release plates that I have traced during my time in the keyboard hobby. It features plates for boards that I have owned but do not have access to plate files from, thus leading to me tracing the plates for them to make aftermarket plates.

## Disclaimer
These files are traced from a physical plate sample and provided as-is. They may not be as accurate as the CAD files used in the original productions of the boards featured.
They may not work. I am not responsible for inaccurate production should you use these files.
I will order prototypes of plates where necesscary to verify that they are working.
